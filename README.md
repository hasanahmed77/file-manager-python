# file-manager-python

A python script that automatically creates folders and moves files based on file extensions.

About the script:
- 'fswatch' is used to watch the Download folder. If there is any file added, the script gets executed and the files move to the appropriate folder.
- A shell script, which starts on startup, is used to run the python script.

Therefore, once setup, it will run and sort files automatically to keep the folders organized!
